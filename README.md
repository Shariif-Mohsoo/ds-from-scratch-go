# Distributed Systems Lab with Go

This repository documents my journey of learning Distributed Systems using the Go programming language. It includes hands-on projects, labs, networking protocols, and practical system design concepts inspired by real-world use cases and MIT 6.824.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects and Labs

### ðŸš€ Decentralized File Storage
A content-addressable, peer-to-peer distributed storage system built in Go (based on AnthonyGG's course).

### ðŸ“š MIT 6.824 Labs
Implementation of labs including MapReduce, Raft consensus, and more.

### ðŸ§  Core Concepts Explored
- Goroutines, channels, mutexes, waitgroups
- TCP, RPC, gRPC, P2P
- Raft consensus
- Docker and distributed deployment
- File encryption and streaming

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure
See folders for each module and project. All code is organized, tested, and commented with learnings.
